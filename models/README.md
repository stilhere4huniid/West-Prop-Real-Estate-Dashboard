## 🏗️ Models Overview

### 1. ROI Prediction Model (Random Forest Regressor)
- **Purpose**: Predicts potential ROI for real estate properties based on various features
- **Input Features**:
  - Property details (size, bedrooms, bathrooms, location)
  - Smart home features (solar, water recycling, smart locks, etc.)
  - Market conditions
- **Output**: Predicted ROI percentage
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - R² Score: 0.55 (test set)
  - Mean Absolute Error: 0.45 (test set)
  - Mean Squared Error: 0.34 (test set)
  - Root Mean Squared Error: 0.58 (test set)

### 2. ROI Calculator
- **Purpose**: Calculates detailed ROI metrics including:
  - Gross ROI (Traditional ROI)
  - Smart ROI (with smart features)
  - Monthly and annual savings from smart features
  - Net ROI after expenses

## 🛠️ Usage

### Running the Model
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `train_roi_model.ipynb` to retrain the model with new data
3. For ROI analysis, use `roi_calculations_with_details.ipynb`
4. For interactive simulations, use `roi_simulator.ipynb`

### Loading the Pre-trained Model
```python
import joblib
import pandas as pd

# Load the model and transformer
model = joblib.load('roi_prediction_model.pkl')
transformer = joblib.load('roi_transformer.pkl')

# Load feature list
with open('model_features.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    feature_columns = joblib.load(f)

# Prepare your input data (must match feature_columns)
# ...

# Transform and predict
X_transformed = transformer.transform(X)
predictions = model.predict(X_transformed)
```

## 📈 ROI Analysis

The `roi_calculations_with_details.ipynb` notebook provides comprehensive analysis of:
1. Impact of individual smart features on ROI
2. Comparison between traditional and smart properties
3. Cost-benefit analysis of smart home investments
4. Visualization of ROI across different property types and locations

## 📝 Notes
- The model was trained on a dataset of 300 properties (240 training, 60 test)
- For best results, retrain the model periodically with updated market data
- The model's predictions are estimates and should be used as one of several factors in investment decisions
